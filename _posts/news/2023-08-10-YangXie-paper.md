<b>Abstract</b>:
	"We previously reported Paired-Tag, a combinatorial indexing-based method that can simultaneously map histone modifications and gene expression at single-cell resolution at scale. However, the lengthy procedure of Paired-Tag has hindered its general adoption in the community. To address this bottleneck, we developed a droplet-based Paired-Tag protocol that is faster and more accessible than the previous method. Using cultured mammalian cells and primary brain tissues, we demonstrate its superior performance at identifying candidate cis-regulatory elements and associating their dynamic chromatin state to target gene expression in each constituent cell type in a complex tissue."
