    abstract: " Unraveling the complexity of transcriptional programs coded by different cell types has been one of the central goals of cell biology. By using genome-wide location analysis, we examined how two different cell types generate different responses to the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. We showed that, after TNF-alpha treatment, the NF-kappaB p65 subunit binds to distinct genome locations and subsequently induces different subsets of genes in human monocytic THP-1 cells versus HeLa cells. Interestingly, the differential p65 binding in two cell types  correlates with preexisting cell type-specific enhancers before TNF-alpha stimulation, marked by histone modifications. We also found that two transcription factors, PU.1 and C/EBPalpha, appear to synergistically mediate enhancer creation and affect NF-kappaB target selection in THP-1 cells. In HeLa cells, coexpression of PU.1 and C/EBPalpha conferred TNF-alpha responsiveness to  a subset of THP-1-specific NF-kappaB target genes. These results suggest that the diversity of transcriptional programs in mammalian cells arises, at least in part, from preexisting enhancers that are established by cell-specific transcription factors.,"
