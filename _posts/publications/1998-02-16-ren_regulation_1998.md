    abstract: " The stage-specific expression of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene is achieved through the alternate activation of two tandem promoters. The proximal promoter is active primarily during late embryonic development and early larval stages, while the distal promoter is active in late third instar larvae and adults. Here, we provide evidence that this Adh promoter switch is regulated by a zinc finger repressor protein (AEF-1) that is expressed predominantly in adult flies and targets the initiator region of the proximal promoter. We propose that AEF-1 plays a critical role in Adh promoter switching by blocking interactions between a component of the general transcription machinery and the initiator region of the proximal promoter.,"
