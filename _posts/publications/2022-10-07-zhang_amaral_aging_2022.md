    abstract: " Loss of heterochromatin has been implicated as a cause of pre-mature aging and age-associated decline in organ functions in mammals, however, the specific cell types and gene loci affected by this type of epigenetic changes have remained unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we probe the chromatin accessibility at single cell resolution in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and bone marrows from young, middle-aged, and old mice, and assess age-associated changes at 353,126 candidate regulatory elements (cCREs) across 32 major cell types. Unexpectedly, we detected increased chromatin accessibility within specific heterochromatin domains in excitatory neurons in old mice. The gain of chromatin accessibility at these genomic loci is accompanied by a cell-type-specific loss of heterochromatin and activation of LINE1 elements. Immunostaining further confirms the loss of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 in these neurons but not in inhibitory neurons and glia cells. Our results reveal cell-type-specific changes in chromatin landscapes in old mice and shed light on the scope of heterochromatin loss in mammalian aging."
