  abstract = {Enhancers act to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression by facilitating the transcription of target genes. In mammalian cells, active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type-specific manner. Whether and how this histone modification regulates enhancer-dependent transcription programs in mammals is unclear. In this study, we conducted {SILAC} mass spectrometry experiments with mononucleosomes and identified multiple H3K4me1-associated proteins, including many involved in chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that H3K4me1 augments association of the chromatin-remodeling complex {BAF} to enhancers in vivo and that, in vitro, H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the {BAF} complex. Crystal structures of the {BAF} component {BAF}45C indicate that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated by {BAF}45C's H3K4-binding site. Our results suggest that H3K4me1 has an active role at enhancers by facilitating binding of the {BAF} complex and possibly other chromatin regulators.},

  abstract = {Long-range chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters are essential for transcription of many developmentally controlled genes in mammals and other metazoans. Currently, the exact mechanisms that connect distal enhancers to their specific target promoters remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that the enhancer-specific histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and the histone methyltransferases {MLL}3 and {MLL}4 ({MLL}3/4) play an active role in this process. We demonstrate that in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, {MLL}3/4-dependent deposition of H3K4me1 at enhancers correlates with increased levels of chromatin interactions, whereas loss of this histone modification leads to reduced levels of chromatin interactions and defects in gene activation during differentiation. H3K4me1 facilitates recruitment of the Cohesin complex, a known regulator of chromatin organization, to chromatin in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential mechanism for {MLL}3/4 to promote chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Taken together, our results support a role for {MLL}3/4-dependent H3K4me1 in orchestrating long-range chromatin interactions at enhancers in mammalian cells.},

We used it to interrogate the 2-Mb {POU}5F1 locus in human embryonic stem cells, and identified 45 cis-regulatory elements. A majority of these elements have active chromatin marks, {DNase} hypersensitivity, and occupancy by multiple transcription factors, which confirms the utility of chromatin signatures in cis-element mapping. Notably, 17 of them are previously annotated promoters of functionally unrelated genes, and like typical enhancers, they form extensive spatial contacts with the {POU}5F1 promoter.

A fundamental but as-yet unaddressed question, however, is whether it can be diagnosed reproducibly. In this study, by analyzing 80 colorectal adenocarcinomas whose dominant growth pattern was solid (thus encompassing medullary carcinoma and its mimics), we provided a detailed description of the morphological spectrum from "classic medullary histology" to non-medullary poorly-differentiated histologies and demonstrated significant overlapping between categories. By assessing a selected  subset (n=30) that represented the spectrum of histologies, we showed that the inter-observer agreement for diagnosing medullary carcinoma by using 2010 World-Health-Organization criteria was poor; the Kappa value among 5 gastrointestinal pathologists was only 0.157 (95\% confidence-interval, 0.127-0.263; P=.001). When we arbitrarily classified the entire cohort into "classic" and "indeterminate" medullary tumors (group 1, n=19; group 2, n=26, respectively) and non-medullary poorly-differentiated tumors (group 3, n=35), groups 1 and 2 were more likely to exhibit mismatch-repair-protein-deficiency than group 3 (P{\textless}.001); however, improved survival could not be detected in neither group compared to group 3. Our findings suggest that the diagnosis of medullary carcinoma, as currently applied, may only serve as a morphological descriptor indicating an increased likelihood of mismatch-repair-deficiency. Additional evidence including more objective classification system is needed before medullary carcinoma can be regarded as a distinct entity with prognostic relevance. Until such evidence becomes available, caution should be exercised when making this diagnosis, and when comparing results across different studies.},

Dynamic histone modifications may have important roles in {MZT}, but direct measurements of chromatin states have been hindered by technical difficulties in profiling histone modifications from small quantities of cells. Recent improvements allow for 500 cell-equivalents of chromatin per reaction, but require 10,000 cells for  initial steps or require a highly specialized microfluidics device that is not readily available. We developed a micro-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing ({muChIP}-seq) method, which we used to profile genome-wide histone H3 lysine methylation (H3K4me3) and acetylation (H3K27ac) in mouse immature and metaphase {II} oocytes and in 2-cell and 8-cell embryos. Notably, we show that {\textasciitilde}22\% of the oocyte genome is associated with broad H3K4me3 domains that are anti-correlated with {DNA} methylation. The H3K4me3 signal becomes confined to transcriptional-start-site regions in 2-cell embryos, concomitant with the onset  of major zygotic genome activation. Active removal of broad H3K4me3 domains by the lysine demethylases {KDM}5A and {KDM}5B is required for normal zygotic genome activation and is essential for early embryo development. Our results provide insight into the onset of the developmental program in mouse embryos and demonstrate a role for broad H3K4me3 domains in {MZT}.},

This process is crucial for a robust immune response  and an imbalance might lead to disease states such as autoimmune diseases or allergy. Therefore, identification of genes involved in this process is paramount to further understand the pathogenesis of, and design interventions for, immune-mediated diseases. {METHODS}: We aimed at identifying protein-coding genes and long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) involved in early differentiation of T-helper  cells by transcriptome analysis of cord blood-derived naive precursor, primary and polarized cells. {RESULTS}: Here, we identified lineage-specific genes involved in early differentiation of Th1 and Th2 subsets by integrating transcriptional profiling data from multiple platforms. We have obtained a high confidence list of genes as well as a list of novel genes by employing more than one profiling platform. We show that the density of lineage-specific epigenetic marks is higher around lineage-specific genes than anywhere else in the genome. Based on next-generation sequencing data we identified lineage-specific {lncRNAs} involved in early Th1 and Th2 differentiation and predicted their expected functions through Gene Ontology analysis. We show that there is a positive trend in the expression of the closest lineage-specific {lncRNA} and gene pairs. We also found out that there is an enrichment of disease {SNPs} around a number of {lncRNAs} identified, suggesting that these {lncRNAs} might play a role in the etiology of autoimmune diseases. {CONCLUSION}: The results presented here show the involvement  of several new actors in the early differentiation of T-helper cells and will be  a valuable resource for better understanding of autoimmune processes.},

Typing the sequence of these loci has a wide range of applications including organ transplantation, drug discovery, pharmacogenomics and furthering fundamental research in immune genetics. Rapid advances in biochemical and next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies have enabled several strategies for precise genotyping and phasing of candidate {HLA} alleles. Nonetheless, as typing of candidate {HLA} alleles alone reveals limited aspects of the genetics of {MHC} region, it is insufficient for the comprehensive utility of the aforementioned applications. For this reason, we believe phasing the entire {MHC} and {KIR} locus onto a single locus-spanning haplotype can be a critical improvement for better understanding transplantation biology. {RESULTS}: Generating long-range ({\textgreater}1 Mb) phase information is traditionally very challenging. As proximity-ligation based  methods of {DNA} sequencing preserves chromosome-span phase information, we have utilized this principle to demonstrate its utility towards generating full-length phasing of {MHC} and {KIR} loci in human samples. We accurately ({\textasciitilde}99\%) reconstruct the complete haplotypes for over 90\% of sequence variants (coding and non-coding) within these two loci that collectively span 4-megabases. {CONCLUSIONS}: By haplotyping a majority of coding and non-coding alleles at the {MHC} and {KIR} loci in a single assay, this method has the potential to assist transplantation matching and facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of human immunity and  disease.},

Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of {CTCF}-binding sites ({CBSs}) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined {CRISPR}/Cas9-based genomic-{DNA}-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of {CBSs} determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and beta-globin as model genes. Inversion of {CBS} elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and  alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying {CBSs} can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded  by linear genome sequences.},

In contrast to the single-motif {CTCF} target sites (1xCTSes), the 2xCTS elements are  preferentially found at active promoters and enhancers, both in cancer and germ cells. 2xCTSes are also enriched in genomic regions that escape histone to protamine replacement in human and mouse sperm. Depletion of the {BORIS} gene leads to altered transcription of a large number of genes and the differentiation of K562 cells, while the ectopic expression of this {CTCF} paralog leads to specific changes in transcription in {MCF}7 cells. {CONCLUSIONS}: We discover two functionally and structurally different classes of {CTCF} binding regions, 2xCTSes and 1xCTSes,  revealed by their predisposition to bind {BORIS}.

Here we describe methidiumpropyl-{EDTA} sequencing ({MPE}-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin  that involves the digestion of nuclei {withMPE}-Fe({II}) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease ({MNase}), {MPE}-Fe({II}) preferentially cleaves the linker {DNA} between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by {MPE}-Fe({II}) relative to {MNase}. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with {MPE}-seq but not with {MNase}-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. The subnucleosome-sized {MPE}-seq peaks exhibit a particularly distinct association with active promoters. In addition, unlike {MNase}, {MPE}-Fe({II}) cleaves nuclear {DNA}  with little sequence bias. In this regard, we found that {DNA} sequences at {RNA} splice sites are hypersensitive to digestion by {MNase} but not by {MPE}-Fe({II}). This phenomenon may have affected the analysis of nucleosome occupancy over exons. These findings collectively indicate that {MPE}-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal {DNA} sequence bias. In particular, the combined use of {MPE}-seq and {MNase}-seq enables the identification of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the regulation of gene expression.},

Here, we report that epigenetic priming of enhancers signifies developmental competence during endodermal lineage diversification. Chromatin mapping during pancreatic and hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells revealed the en masse acquisition of a poised chromatin state at enhancers specific to endoderm-derived cell lineages in gut tube intermediates. Experimentally, the acquisition of this poised enhancer state predicts the ability of endodermal intermediates to respond to inductive signals. Furthermore, these enhancers are first recognized by the pioneer transcription factors {FOXA}1 and {FOXA}2 when competence is acquired, while subsequent recruitment of lineage-inductive transcription factors, such as {PDX}1, leads to enhancer and target gene activation. Together, our results identify the acquisition of a poised chromatin  state at enhancers as a mechanism by which progenitor cells acquire developmental competence.},

Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin  interactions in human embryonic stem ({ES}) cells and four human {ES}-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36\% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased  chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore  provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.},

To test this hypothesis, we used circular chromosome conformation capture coupled with high throughput sequencing (4C-seq) to analyze {FOXP}3-dependent genomic contacts around a known {FOXP}3-bound locus, Ptpn22. Our studies reveal that {FOXP}3  induces significant changes in the chromatin contacts between the Ptpn22 locus and other Foxp3-regulated genes, reflecting a mechanism by which {FOXP}3 reorganizes the genome architecture to coordinate the expression of its target genes.

These core factors form a regulatory circuit controlling the transcription of a number of pluripotency factors including themselves. Although previous studies have identified transcriptional regulators of this core network, the cis-regulatory {DNA} sequences required for the transcription of these key pluripotency factors remain to be defined. We analyzed epigenomic data within the 1.5 Mb gene-desert regions around the Sox2 gene and identified a 13kb-long super-enhancer ({SE}) located 100kb downstream of Sox2 in mouse {ESCs}. This {SE} is occupied by Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and the mediator complex, and physically interacts with the Sox2 locus via {DNA} looping. Using a simple and highly efficient double-{CRISPR} genome editing strategy we deleted the entire 13-kb {SE} and characterized transcriptional defects in the resulting monoallelic and biallelic deletion clones with {RNA}-seq.  We showed that the {SE} is responsible for over 90\% of Sox2 expression, and Sox2 is the only target gene along the chromosome. Our results support the functional significance of a {SE} in maintaining the pluripotency transcription program in mouse {ESCs}.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as the replication-timing program. In mammals, replication timing is cell-type-specific  with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development, primarily in units of 400-800 kilobases ('replication domains'), whose positions  are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements. Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains ({LADs}). Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains ({TADs}) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar  in size to replication domains. However, {TADs} can be further sub-stratified into  smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale. Moreover, attempts to reconcile {TADs} and {LADs} to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure. Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with {TAD} boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent {TADs} that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of {TADs} partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of  replication timing to {LADs} and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.},

While the role of {DNA} methylation in promoter silencing has been well documented, the function of this epigenetic mark at enhancers remains unclear. Recent experiments have demonstrated that enhancers are enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidization product of the Tet family of 5mC dioxygenases and an intermediate  of {DNA} demethylation. These results support the involvement of Tet proteins in the regulation of dynamic {DNA} methylation at enhancers. By mapping {DNA} methylation and hydroxymethylation at base resolution, we find that deletion of Tet2 causes extensive loss of 5hmC at enhancers, accompanied by enhancer hypermethylation, reduction of enhancer activity, and delayed gene induction in the early steps of differentiation. Our results reveal that {DNA} demethylation modulates enhancer activity, and its disruption influences the timing of transcriptome reprogramming during cellular differentiation.},

	abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, histone lysines are frequently acetylated. However, unlike modifications such as methylations, histone acetylation modifications are often considered redundant. As such, the functional roles of distinct histone acetylations are largely unexplored. We previously developed an algorithm {RFECS} to discover the most informative modifications associated with the classification or prediction of mammalian enhancers. Here, we used this tool to identify the modifications most predictive of promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies. Unexpectedly, we found that histone acetylation alone performs well in distinguishing these unique genomic regions. Further, we found the association of characteristic acetylation patterns with genic regions and association of chromatin state with splicing. Taken together, our work underscores the diverse functional roles of histone acetylation in gene regulation and provides several testable hypotheses to dissect these roles.},

Group A received normal partial oxygen pressure and groups B, C, D, E and F were exposed to hyperoxia (75+/-2)\% from postnatal 7d (P7) to P12 to induce retinopathy of prematurity. The rats in groups C, D, E and F were received intravitreal injections of either vehicle ({DMSO}) or sorafenib at P12 (5, 20 and 80 microg, respectively). Then they returned to normoxia after P12. The retinas were whole-mounted and imaged with a confocal microscopy. The vascular branching  points were counted to quantify neovascularization at P17. Cross-sections of the  retina were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ({HE}). The nuclei of new vessels breaking the internal limiting membrane were counted to quantify the proliferative neovascular response. {RESULTS}: The retinal vessel in groups B and C turned into tortuosity and a great deal of neovascularization were observed. Sorafenib-treated rats had significantly less neovascularization as compared with vehicle-treated and control rats in a dose dependent manner (P{\textless}0.05). The number  of vascular branching points in A, B, C, D, E and F were 16.50+/-3.90, 37.44+/-6.47, 37.08+/-5.10, 30.80+/-6.85, 26.08+/-5.08 and 19.83+/-3.51, respectively.

The resulting genome-wide data reveal sites of biochemical activity with high positional resolution and cell type specificity that facilitate studies of gene regulation and interpretation of noncoding variants associated with human disease. However, the biochemically active regions cover a much larger fraction of the genome than do evolutionarily  conserved regions, raising the question of whether nonconserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional.

We also analyze the relationship between signal intensity, genomic coverage, and evolutionary conservation.

However, the role of {SMARCA}4 in tissue-specific gene regulation during embryogenesis remains poorly defined. To investigate the genome-wide binding landscape of {SMARCA}4 in differentiating tissues, we engineered a Smarca4({FLAG}) knock-in mouse line. Using {ChIP}-seq, we identified approximately 51,000 {SMARCA}4-associated regions across six embryonic mouse tissues (forebrain, hindbrain, neural tube, heart, limb, and face) at mid-gestation (E11.5). The majority of these regions was distal from promoters and showed dynamic occupancy, with most distal {SMARCA}4 sites (73\%) confined to a  single or limited subset of tissues. To further characterize these regions, we profiled active and repressive histone marks in the same tissues and examined the intersection of informative chromatin states and {SMARCA}4 binding. This revealed distinct classes of distal {SMARCA}4-associated elements characterized by activating and repressive chromatin signatures that were associated with tissue-specific up- or down-regulation of gene expression and relevant active/repressed biological pathways. We further demonstrate the predicted active regulatory properties of {SMARCA}4-associated elements by retrospective analysis of tissue-specific enhancers and direct testing of {SMARCA}4-bound regions in transgenic mouse assays. Our results indicate a dual active/repressive function of {SMARCA}4 at distal regulatory sequences in vivo and support its role in tissue-specific gene regulation during embryonic development.},

Main outcome measures included uncorrected visual acuity ({UCVA}), refraction, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ({BSCVA}), endothelial cell density ({ECD}), intraocular pressure ({IOP}), lens transparency, postoperative uveitis. Visante anterior segment optical coherence tomography ({AS}-{OCT}) was used to measure anterior chamber depth ({ACD}) and the position of {ICL}. {RESULTS}: Mean follow-up was 6.54+/-3.26 months (range 3-12 months). Predictability of the manifest spherical  equivalent ({SE}) refraction to within +/-1.00D was achieved in 88\% of eyes and +/-0.50D in 72.5\% of eyes. The mean postoperative manifest {SE} refraction was -1.85+/-0.72D, with 96.34\% of eyes maintaining or gaining {\textgreater}/=1 line(s) of {BSCVA}.  The mean 3-month postoperative {ECD} decreased but had no statistically difference  compared with the preoperative {ECD}. Of the 7 eyes (8.54\%) with a mild transient increase in intraocular pressure (up to 30mmHg), none required a second surgical  procedure or prolonged topical medication. There was no loss of lens transparency. Pigmented precipitates were observed in 5 eyes (6.09\%). The mean preoperative {ACD} measured with {AS}-{OCT} was 3.28+/-0.14mm, three months after surgery, the mean {ACD} was 2.45+/-0.22mm.

To determine the role of cohesin and {CTCF} in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or {CTCF} and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of {CTCF} not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become  misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and {CTCF}.

Here, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive map of occluded genes in somatic cells. Specifically, we mapped occluded genes in mouse fibroblasts via fusion to a dozen different rat cell types followed by whole-transcriptome profiling. We found that occluded genes are highly prevalent and stable in somatic cells, representing a sizeable fraction of silent genes. Occluded genes are also highly enriched for important developmental regulators of alternative lineages, consistent with the role of occlusion in safeguarding cell identities. Alongside this map, we also present whole-genome maps of {DNA} methylation and eight other chromatin marks. These maps  uncover a complex relationship between chromatin state and occlusion. Furthermore, we found that {DNA} methylation functions as the memory of occlusion in a subset of occluded genes, while histone deacetylation contributes to the implementation but not memory of occlusion. Our data suggest that the identities  of individual cell types are defined largely by the occlusion status of their genomes. The comprehensive reference maps reported here provide the foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the role of occlusion in development and disease.},

	abstract = {N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal (non-cap) modification present in the messenger {RNA} of all higher eukaryotes. Although essential to cell viability and development, the exact role of m(6)A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m(6)A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m(6)A in basic biological functions and disease. Here we show that m(6)A is selectively recognized by the human {YTH} domain family 2 ({YTHDF}2) 'reader' protein to regulate {mRNA} degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular {RNA} targets of {YTHDF}2, most of which are {mRNAs}, but which also include non-coding {RNAs}, with a conserved core motif of G(m(6)A)C. We further establish the role of {YTHDF}2 in {RNA} metabolism, showing that binding of {YTHDF}2 results in the localization of bound {mRNA} from the translatable pool to {mRNA} decay sites, such as processing bodies. The carboxy-terminal domain of {YTHDF}2 selectively binds to m(6)A-containing {mRNA}, whereas the amino-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the {YTHDF}2-{mRNA} complex to cellular {RNA} decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m(6)A modification is recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of {mRNA}.},

We use proximity ligation and sequencing to show that alleles on homologous chromosomes  occupy distinct territories, and therefore this experimental protocol preferentially recovers physically linked {DNA} variants on a homolog. Computational analysis of such data sets allows for accurate ( approximately 99.5\%) reconstruction of chromosome-spanning haplotypes for approximately 95\% of  alleles in hybrid mouse cells with 30x sequencing coverage. To resolve haplotypes for a human genome, which has a low density of variants, we coupled {HaploSeq} with local conditional phasing to obtain haplotypes for approximately 81\% of alleles with approximately 98\% accuracy from just 17x sequencing. Whereas methods based on proximity ligation were originally designed to investigate spatial organization of genomes, our results lend support for their use as a general tool for haplotyping.},

We identified complex regulatory landscapes consisting  of enhancers that drive spatially complex developmental expression patterns. Analysis of mouse lines in which individual craniofacial enhancers had been deleted revealed significant alterations of craniofacial shape, demonstrating the functional importance of enhancers in defining face and skull morphology.

One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques. However, previous studies  lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map  generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C). We  determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5-10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter-enhancer contacts after {TNF}-alpha signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that {TNF}-alpha-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular  cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.},

In the normal group,  mice were housed in normoxic conditions from postnatal day P7 to P17. Mice in the other 3 groups were placed under hyperoxic conditions (75+/-2\%O2) in an oxygen-regulated chamber for 5 days and subsequently placed in normoxic conditions for 5 days. Mice in the {AG} group were treated once daily, from P12 to  P17, with {AG} hemisulfate (100mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) dissolved in physiological saline. An equivalent amount of 0.9\% physiological saline was administered, as above, to mice in the high oxygen saline group. Ten mice were randomly selected from each group on P14 and on P17, euthanized and the retinas examined. Apoptotic cells in the retina were detected using the terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling ({TUNEL}) method. The expression of nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) in the retina was detected by immunohistochemistry and changes in rod cells were observed using electron microscopy. {RESULTS}: {TUNEL}-positive cells and {iNOS} immunoreactive neurons were present in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell retinal layers of mice in the high oxygen group. The number of {TUNEL}-positive cells was significantly greater in the high oxygen group compared with the normal group (t=-20.81, P 14d {\textless}0.05; t=-15.05, P 17d {\textless}0.05). However, the number of {TUNEL}-positive cells in the {AG} treatment group was significantly lower (t=-13.21, P 14d{\textless}0.05; t=-6.61, P 17d {\textless}0.05) compared with the high oxygen group. The expression of {iNOS} was significantly higher in the high oxygen group compared with the normal group (t=-21.95, P 14d{\textless}0.05; t=-17.30, P 17d{\textless}0.05).

The outer segments of the rods were disorganized and short in the high oxygen group. Rod morphology appeared to  be slightly improved in the {AG} group. {CONCLUSION}: {AG} may protect retinal neurons  in {OIR} by inhibiting apoptosis. The mechanism may be related to {iNOS}.},

The correct response to cytokines and a controlled balance of these populations is critical for the immune system and the avoidance of autoimmune disorders. To investigate how early cell-fate commitment is regulated, we generated the first human genome-wide maps  of histone modifications that reveal enhancer elements after 72 hr of in vitro polarization toward T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cell lineages. Our analysis indicated that even at this very early time point, cell-specific gene regulation and enhancers were at work directing lineage commitment. Further examination of lineage-specific enhancers identified transcription factors ({TFs})  with known and unknown T cell roles as putative drivers of lineage-specific gene  expression. Lastly, an integrative analysis of immunopathogenic-associated {SNPs} suggests a role for distal regulatory elements in disease etiology.},

We found that promoters that are active in early developmental stages tend to be {CG} rich and mainly engage H3K27me3 upon silencing in nonexpressing lineages. By contrast, promoters for genes expressed preferentially at later stages are often {CG} poor and primarily employ {DNA} methylation upon repression. Interestingly, the early developmental regulatory genes are often located in large genomic domains that are generally devoid of {DNA} methylation in  most lineages, which we termed {DNA} methylation valleys ({DMVs}).

Expression of {HMGA}1 was seen in 21\% of the reactive atypia cases, 42\% of adenomas, and 91\% of adenocarcinomas. {HMGA}2 was positive in 14\% of reactive atypias, 42\% of adenomas, and 86\% of adenocarcinomas. The staining intensity of {HMGA}1 and {HMGA}2 was also significantly higher in adenocarcinomas than in adenomas or reactive atypias. Interestingly, coexpression of {HMGA}1 and {HMGA}2 was found in 86\% of adenocarcinomas, 0\% of reactive atypias, and 8\% of adenomas. p53 and beta-catenin expression seemed not to provide additional value for discriminating adenocarcinoma from reactive atypia or adenoma. {CONCLUSIONS}: {HMGA}1 and {HMGA}2 might serve to discriminate between reactive atypia, adenoma and adenocarcinoma in ampulla and common bile duct biopsies.},

Recently, it was shown that enhancers in the mammalian genome are associated with characteristic histone modification patterns, which have been increasingly exploited for enhancer identification. However, only a limited number of cell types or chromatin marks have previously been investigated for this purpose, leaving the question unanswered whether there exists an optimal set of histone modifications for enhancer prediction in different cell types. Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, {RFECS} (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles  for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types. We show that {RFECS} not only leads to more accurate and precise prediction of enhancers than previous methods, but also helps identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction.},

The recently available  epigenomic data in multiple cell types provide an unprecedented opportunity for a comparative study of epigenetic landscape. We developed a machine-learning method called {ChroModule} to annotate the epigenetic states in eight {ENCyclopedia} Of {DNA}  Elements cell types. The trained model successfully captured the characteristic histone-modification patterns associated with regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, and showed superior performance on identifying enhancers compared with the state-of-art methods. In addition, given the fixed number of epigenetic states in the model, {ChroModule} allows straightforward illustration of epigenetic variability in multiple cell types. Using this feature, we found that  invariable and variable epigenetic states across cell types correspond to housekeeping functions and stimulus response, respectively. Especially, we observed that enhancers, but not the other regulatory elements, dictate cell specificity, as similar cell types share common enhancers, and cell-type-specific enhancers are often bound by transcription factors playing critical roles in that cell type. More interestingly, we found some genomic regions are dormant in cell  type but primed to become active in other cell types. These observations highlight the usefulness of {ChroModule} in comparative analysis and interpretation of multiple epigenomes.},

Here we present an approach, {TAmC}-Seq, which selectively tags 5-methylcytosine with an azide functionality that can be further labelled with a biotin for affinity purification, detection and genome-wide mapping. Using this covalent labelling approach, we demonstrate high  sensitivity and specificity for known methylated loci, as well as increased {CpG} dinucleotide coverage at lower sequencing depth as compared with antibody-based enrichment, providing an improved efficiency in the 5-methylcytosine enrichment and genome-wide profiling.},

Here, we show that conditional deletion of the histone acetyltransferase cofactor Trrap in mouse {ESCs} triggers unscheduled differentiation associated with loss of  histone acetylation, condensation of chromatin into distinct foci (heterochromatization), and uncoupling of H3K4 dimethylation and H3K27 trimethylation. Trrap loss results in downregulation of stemness master genes Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 and marked upregulation of specific differentiation markers from the three germ layers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis of  genome-wide binding revealed a significant overlap between Oct4 and Trrap binding in {ESCs} but not in differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, further supporting a functional interaction between Trrap and Oct4 in the maintenance of stemness. Remarkably, failure to downregulate Trrap prevents differentiation of {ESCs}, suggesting that downregulation of Trrap may be a critical step guiding transcriptional reprogramming and differentiation of {ESCs}. These findings establish Trrap as a critical part of the mechanism that restricts differentiation and promotes the maintenance of key features of {ESCs}.},

Mutant {NSCs} showed increased susceptibility to proteasomal stress as well as passage-dependent deficiencies in nuclear-envelope organization, clonal expansion and neuronal differentiation. Disease phenotypes were rescued by targeted correction of the {LRRK}2(G2019S) mutation with its wild-type counterpart in Parkinson's disease {iPSCs} and were recapitulated after targeted knock-in of the {LRRK}2(G2019S) mutation in human embryonic stem cells. Analysis of human brain tissue showed nuclear-envelope impairment in clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients.

	abstract = {Pneumococcal surface protein A ({PspA}) is a surface molecule on pneumococci that is required for full virulence in mouse models of infection. {PspA} has been reported to inhibit complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface. It has been assumed that this decreased complement deposition results in the inefficient phagocytosis of wild-type pneumococci. However, an effect of {PspA} on phagocytosis had not been shown. Our present studies demonstrated that a loss of {PspA} by capsular type 3 strains {WU}2 and A66.1 led to enhanced complement-dependent phagocytosis of the pneumococci by the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1. This observation was made using human complement as well as mouse complement. Since this enhanced phagocytosis could be blocked by antibody to complement receptor {CR}3 on J774A.1, it was concluded that {PspA}'s effect on phagocytosis was due to its effect on the amount of deposited complement, which in turn helped opsonize the pneumococci for phagocytosis. Since these studies included new independent mutants lacking {PspA}, the results provide solid confirmation of the previously reported effects of {PspA} on pneumococcal virulence and complement deposition. Finally, we showed that antibody to {PspA}, which is also known to enhance complement deposition, also enhances the phagocytosis of pneumococci in a largely complement-dependent manner.},

The 2.6 x 10(9) bases of the mouse genome possess a high degree of conservation with the human genome, so a thorough annotation of the mouse genome will be of significant value to understanding the function of the human genome. So far, most of the functional sequences in the mouse genome have yet to be found, and the cis-regulatory sequences in particular are still poorly  annotated. Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of these sequences, but on its own it cannot resolve their temporal and spatial functions. Recently, {ChIP}-Seq has been developed to identify cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we apply the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues and cell types in the mouse to produce a  map of nearly 300,000 murine cis-regulatory sequences. The annotated sequences add up to 11\% of the mouse genome, and include more than 70\% of conserved non-coding sequences. We define tissue-specific enhancers and identify potential  transcription factors regulating gene expression in each tissue or cell type. Finally, we show that much of the mouse genome is organized into domains of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome and for the study of mechanisms regulating tissue-specific gene expression.},

Approximately 30\% of the identified common targets of microarray and {ChIP}-chip assays overlap with the human t(8;21)-gene expression molecular signature. {CD}45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase and a negative regulator of cytokine/growth factor receptor  and {JAK}/{STAT} signaling, is among those targets.

Re-expression of {CD}45 suppresses {JAK}/{STAT} activation, delays leukemia development, and promotes apoptosis of t(8;21)-positive cells. This study demonstrates the benefit of combining gene expression and promoter occupancy profiling assays to identify molecular and potential therapeutic targets in human cancers and describes a previously unappreciated signaling pathway involving t(8;21) fusion proteins, {CD}45, and {JAK}/{STAT}, which could be a potential novel target for treating t(8;21) {AML}.},

Although numerous genes/proteins such as Oct4 and Gata6 have been identified to play critical regulatory roles in  self-renewal and differentiation of {hESC}, the majority of the regulators in these cellular processes and more importantly how these regulators co-operate with each other and/or with epigenetic modifications are still largely unknown. We propose  here a systematic approach to integrate genomic and epigenomic data for identification of direct regulatory interactions. This approach allows reconstruction of cell-type-specific transcription networks in embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}) and fibroblasts at an unprecedented scale. Many links in the reconstructed networks coincide with known regulatory interactions or literature  evidence. Systems-level analyses of these networks not only uncover novel regulators for pluripotency and differentiation, but also reveal extensive interplays between transcription factor binding and epigenetic modifications. Especially, we observed poised enhancers characterized by both active (H3K4me1) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks that contain enriched Oct4- and Suz12-binding sites. The success of such a systems biology approach is further supported by experimental validation of the predicted interactions.},

Genome-wide localization analysis reveals {CBX}3 binding at genic regions, which strongly correlates with gene activity across multiple cell types. Depletion of {CBX}3 resulted in down-regulation of a subset of target genes. Loss of {CBX}3 binding leads to a more dramatic accumulation of unspliced nascent transcripts.

We here present a genome-wide approach, Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing ({TAB}-Seq), that when combined with traditional bisulfite sequencing can be used for mapping 5hmC at base resolution  and quantifying the relative abundance of 5hmC as well as 5mC. Application of this method to embryonic stem cells not only confirms widespread distribution of  5hmC in the mammalian genome but also reveals sequence bias and strand asymmetry  at 5hmC sites. We observe high levels of 5hmC and reciprocally low levels of 5mC  near but not on transcription factor-binding sites. Additionally, the relative abundance of 5hmC varies significantly among distinct functional sequence elements, suggesting different mechanisms for 5hmC deposition and maintenance.},

Immunohistochemical analysis of telomerase activity of each xenograft was operated two days after in vivo imaging. The binding efficiency of Gd-{DOTA}-{ASON} reached as high as 71.7 +/- 4.5\% (n = 6). Gd-{DOTA}-{ASON} displayed perfect stability in fresh human serum at 37 degrees C for 24 h.

The signal intensity of A549 xenografts can be enhanced by Gd-{DOTA}-{ASON} and the signal to noise ratio ({SNR}) of tumor to muscle reached 2.37 and maintained a relatively high level within 6 h after injection. The activity of {hTERT} in A549 tumors can be suppressed by Gd-{DOTA}-{ASON} in pathological slices.

In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic  technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome  organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein {CTCF}, housekeeping genes, transfer {RNAs} and short interspersed element ({SINE}) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

Here, we show that Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3) is a component of {PRC}2 that promotes {ESC} self-renewal. Using mass spectrometry, we identified Pcl3 as a Suz12 binding partner and confirmed Pcl3 interactions with core {PRC}2 components by co-immunoprecipitation. Knockdown of Pcl3 in {ESCs} increases spontaneous differentiation, yet does not affect early differentiation decisions as assessed  in teratomas and embryoid bodies, indicating that Pcl3 has a specific role in regulating {ESC} self-renewal. Consistent with Pcl3 promoting {PRC}2 function, decreasing Pcl3 levels reduces H3K27me3 levels while overexpressing Pcl3 increases H3K27me3 levels. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) reveal that Pcl3 co-localizes with {PRC}2 core component, Suz12, and depletion of Pcl3 decreases Suz12 binding at over 60\% of {PRC}2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues within the Pcl3 Tudor domain, a domain implicated  in recognizing methylated histones, compromises H3K27me3 formation, suggesting that the Tudor domain of Pcl3 is essential for function. We also show that Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different {PRC}2 complexes but bind many of the same {PRC}2 targets, particularly {CpG} islands regulated by Pcl3. Thus, Pcl3 is a component of {PRC}2 critical for {ESC} self-renewal, histone methylation, and recruitment of {PRC}2 to a subset of its genomic sites.},

Complementary {ChIP} and {RNAi} analyses reveal that Pol {II}(G) is recruited to promoter regions of subsets of actively transcribed genes, where it appears to restrict transcription.

However, the extent of epigenetic alterations in cancer cells has not  been fully characterized. Here, we describe complete methylome maps at single nucleotide resolution of a low-passage breast cancer cell line and primary human  mammary epithelial cells. We find widespread {DNA} hypomethylation in the cancer cell, primarily at partially methylated domains ({PMDs}) in normal breast cells. Unexpectedly, genes within these regions are largely silenced in cancer cells. The loss of {DNA} methylation in these regions is accompanied by formation of repressive chromatin, with a significant fraction displaying allelic {DNA} methylation where one allele is {DNA} methylated while the other allele is occupied by histone modifications H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. Our results show a mutually exclusive relationship between {DNA} methylation and H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. These results suggest that global {DNA} hypomethylation in breast cancer is tightly linked to the formation of repressive chromatin domains and gene silencing, thus  identifying a potential epigenetic pathway for gene regulation in cancer cells.},

While it has been generally held that pluripotency is  the product of a transcriptional regulatory network that activates and maintains  the expression of key stem cell genes, accumulating evidence is pointing to a critical role for epigenetic processes in establishing and safeguarding the pluripotency of {ES} cells, as well as maintaining the identity of differentiated cell types. In order to better understand the role of epigenetic mechanisms in pluripotency, we have examined the dynamics of chromatin modifications genome-wide in human {ES} cells ({hESCs}) undergoing differentiation into a mesendodermal lineage. We found that chromatin modifications at promoters remain  largely invariant during differentiation, except at a small number of promoters where a dynamic switch between acetylation and methylation at H3K27 marks the transition between activation and silencing of gene expression, suggesting a hierarchy in cell fate commitment over most differentially expressed genes. We also mapped over 50 000 potential enhancers, and observed much greater dynamics in chromatin modifications, especially H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which correlate with  expression of their potential target genes. Further analysis of these enhancers revealed potentially key transcriptional regulators of pluripotency and a chromatin signature indicative of a poised state that may confer developmental competence in {hESCs}.

The lymphoblastoid genome presents a comparable number and similar spectrum of nucleotide substitutions to that found in the tumor genome. However, a significant difference in the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions was observed between both genomes (P = 0.031). Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that mutations in the tumor genome preferentially affect hub-genes (P = 0.0017) and are co-selected to present synergistic functions (P {\textless}  0.0001). {KEGG} analysis showed that in the tumor genome most mutated genes were organized into signaling pathways related to tumorigenesis.

We produced a map of the Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300 chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for  eight chromatin features, five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors at different stages of development. Using these data we inferred more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. We identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility.

We  generated a series of mouse mutants and embryonic stem ({ES}) cell lines carrying "deletable" and "rescuable" alleles of the lysine-specific demethylase {LSD}1/{KDM}1A. In the absence of {KDM}1A, the murine endogenous retrovirus {MuERV}-L/{MERVL} becomes overexpressed and embryonic development arrests at gastrulation. A number of cellular genes normally restricted to the zygotic genome activation ({ZGA}) period also become up-regulated in Kdm1a mutants. Strikingly, many of these cellular genes are flanked by {MERVL} sequences or have cryptic {LTRs} as promoters that are targets of {KDM}1A repression. Using genome-wide epigenetic profiling of Kdm1a mutant {ES} cells, we demonstrate that this subset of {ZGA} genes and {MERVL} elements displays increased methylation of histone H3K4, increased acetylation of H3K27, and decreased methylation of H3K9. As a consequence, Kdm1a mutant {ES} cells exhibit an unusual propensity to generate extraembryonic tissues.

Despite evidence for a role of the associated interval in neighbouring gene regulation, the biological underpinnings of these genetic associations with {CAD} or type 2 diabetes have not yet been explained. Here we identify 33 enhancers in 9p21; the interval is the second densest gene desert for predicted enhancers and six times denser than the whole genome (P {\textless} 6.55 x 10(-33)). The {CAD} risk alleles of {SNPs} rs10811656 and rs10757278 are located in one of these enhancers and disrupt a binding site for {STAT}1. Lymphoblastoid cell  lines homozygous for the {CAD} risk haplotype show no binding of {STAT}1, and in lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the {CAD} non-risk haplotype, binding of {STAT}1 inhibits {CDKN}2BAS (also known as {CDKN}2B-{AS}1) expression, which is reversed  by short interfering {RNA} knockdown of {STAT}1. Using a new, open-ended approach to  detect long-distance interactions, we find that in human vascular endothelial cells the enhancer interval containing the {CAD} locus physically interacts with the {CDKN}2A/B locus, the {MTAP} gene and an interval downstream of {IFNA}21. In human  vascular endothelial cells, interferon-gamma activation strongly affects the structure of the chromatin and the transcriptional regulation in the 9p21 locus,  including {STAT}1-binding, long-range enhancer interactions and altered expression  of neighbouring genes. Our findings establish a link between {CAD} genetic susceptibility and the response to inflammatory signalling in a vascular cell type and thus demonstrate the utility of genome-wide association study findings in directing studies to novel genomic loci and biological processes important for disease aetiology.},

Somatic cell reprogramming involves epigenomic reconfiguration, conferring {iPSCs} with characteristics similar to embryonic stem ({ES}) cells. However, it remains unknown how complete the reestablishment of {ES}-cell-like {DNA} methylation patterns is throughout the genome. Here we report the first whole-genome profiles of {DNA} methylation at single-base resolution in five human {iPSC} lines, along with methylomes of {ES} cells, somatic cells, and differentiated {iPSCs} and {ES} cells. {iPSCs} show significant reprogramming variability, including somatic memory and aberrant reprogramming of {DNA} methylation. {iPSCs} share megabase-scale differentially methylated regions proximal to centromeres and telomeres that display incomplete  reprogramming of non-{CG} methylation, and differences in {CG} methylation and histone modifications. Lastly, differentiation of {iPSCs} into trophoblast cells revealed that errors in reprogramming {CG} methylation are transmitted at a high frequency, providing an {iPSC} reprogramming signature that is maintained after differentiation.},

The analysis was conducted on the  breast cancer cell line {HCC}1954, and a lymphoblast cell line from the same individual, {HCC}1954BL. {RESULTS}: By comparing exome sequences from the two cell lines, we identified loss of heterozygosity events at 403 genes in {HCC}1954 and at one gene in {HCC}1954BL. The combination of exome and transcriptome sequence data also revealed 86 and 50 genes with allele specific expression events in {HCC}1954 and {HCC}1954BL, which comprise 5.4\% and 2.6\% of genes surveyed, respectively. Many of these genes identified by loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression are known or putative tumor suppressor genes, such as {BRCA}1, {MSH}3 and  {SETX}, which participate in {DNA} repair pathways. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results demonstrate that the combined application of high throughput sequencing to exome  and allele-specific transcriptome analysis can reveal genes with known tumor suppressor characteristics, and a shortlist of novel candidates for the study of  tumor suppressor activities.},

We show that transient expression of p16 stably represses the {hTERT} gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, in both normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. Short-term p16 expression increases the amount of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 27 (H3K27) bound to the {hTERT} promoter, resulting in transcriptional silencing, likely mediated by polycomb complexes. Our results indicate that transient p16 exposure may prevent malignant progression in dividing cells by irreversible repression of genes, such as {hTERT}, whose activity is necessary for  extensive self-renewal.},

The diverse cellular properties in different cells have been attributed to their distinct epigenomes, but how much epigenomes differ remains unclear. Here, we report that epigenomic landscapes in {hESCs} and lineage-committed cells are drastically different. By comparing the chromatin-modification profiles and {DNA} methylomes in {hESCs} and primary fibroblasts, we find that nearly one-third of the genome differs in chromatin structure. Most changes arise from dramatic redistributions of repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks, which form blocks that significantly expand in fibroblasts. A large number of potential regulatory sequences also exhibit a high degree of dynamics in chromatin modifications and {DNA} methylation. Additionally, we observe novel, context-dependent relationships between {DNA} methylation and chromatin modifications.

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulation in human cells is a complex process involving a multitude of regulatory elements encoded by the genome. Recent studies have shown that distinct chromatin signatures mark a variety of functional genomic elements  and that subtle variations of these signatures mark elements with different functions. To identify novel chromatin signatures in the human genome, we apply a de novo pattern-finding algorithm to genome-wide maps of histone modifications. We recover previously known chromatin signatures associated with promoters and enhancers. We also observe several chromatin signatures with strong enrichment of H3K36me3 marking exons. Closer examination reveals that H3K36me3 is found on well-positioned nucleosomes at exon 5' ends, and that this modification is a global mark of exon expression that also correlates with alternative splicing. Additionally, we observe strong enrichment of H2BK5me1 and H4K20me1 at highly expressed exons near the 5' end, in contrast to the opposite distribution of H3K36me3-marked exons. Finally, we also recover frequently occurring chromatin signatures displaying enrichment of repressive histone modifications. These signatures mark distinct repeat sequences and are associated with distinct modes  of gene repression. Together, these results highlight the rich information embedded in the human epigenome and underscore its value in studying gene regulation.},

Recently, {ChIP}-chip and {ChIP}-sequencing experiments have been accumulated to identify {TF} binding sites as well as survey the chromatin modification patterns at the regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We propose here a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) to incorporate sequence motif information, {TF}-{DNA} interaction data and chromatin modification patterns to precisely identify cis-regulatory modules ({CRMs}). We conducted {ChIP}-chip experiments on four {TFs}, {CREB}, E2F1, {MAX}, and {YY}1 in 1\% of the human genome. We then trained a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) to identify the labels of the {CRMs} by incorporating the sequence motifs recognized by these {TFs} and the {ChIP}-chip ratio. Chromatin modification data was used to predict the functional sites and to further remove false positives. Cross-validation showed that our integrated {HMM} had a performance superior to other existing methods on predicting {CRMs}. Incorporating histone signature information successfully penalized false prediction and improved the whole performance.

We have previously developed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based microarray method ({ChIP}-chip) to locate promoters, enhancers and insulators in the human genome. Here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their  roles in cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed that the chromatin state at promoters and {CTCF}-binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types. In contrast, enhancers are marked with highly cell-type-specific histone modification patterns, strongly correlate to cell-type-specific gene expression programs on a global scale, and are functionally active in a cell-type-specific manner.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent genomic scale survey of epigenetic states in the mammalian genomes has shown that promoters and enhancers are correlated with distinct chromatin signatures, providing a pragmatic way for systematic mapping of these regulatory elements in the genome. With rapid accumulation of chromatin modification profiles in the genome of various organisms and cell types, this chromatin based approach promises to uncover many new regulatory elements, but computational methods to effectively extract information from these datasets are  still limited. {RESULTS}: We present here a supervised learning method to predict promoters and enhancers based on their unique chromatin modification signatures.  We trained Hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) on the histone modification data for known promoters and enhancers, and then used the trained {HMMs} to identify promoter or enhancer like sequences in the human genome. Using a simulated annealing ({SA}) procedure, we searched for the most informative combination and the optimal window size of histone marks. {CONCLUSION}: Compared with the previous methods, the {HMM} method can capture the complex patterns of histone modifications particularly from the weak signals. Cross validation and scanning the {ENCODE} regions showed that our method outperforms the previous profile-based method in mapping promoters and enhancers. We also showed that including more histone marks can further boost the performance of our method. This observation suggests that the {HMM} is robust and is capable of integrating information from multiple histone marks. To further demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we applied it to analyzing genome wide {ChIP}-Seq data in three mouse cell lines and correctly predicted active and inactive promoters with positive predictive values of more than 80\%.

	abstract = {Computational methods to identify functional genomic elements using genetic information have been very successful in determining gene structure and in identifying a handful of cis-regulatory elements. But the vast majority of regulatory elements have yet to be discovered, and it has become increasingly apparent that their discovery will not come from using genetic information alone. Recently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the creation of information-rich epigenetic maps, most notably for histone modifications. However, tools that search for functional elements using this epigenetic information have been lacking. Here, we describe an unsupervised learning method  called {ChromaSig} to find, in an unbiased fashion, commonly occurring chromatin signatures in both tiling microarray and sequencing data. Applying this algorithm to nine chromatin marks across a 1\% sampling of the human genome in {HeLa} cells, we recover eight clusters of distinct chromatin signatures, five of which correspond to known patterns associated with transcriptional promoters and enhancers. Interestingly, we observe that the distinct chromatin signatures found at enhancers mark distinct functional classes of enhancers in terms of transcription factor and coactivator binding. In addition, we identify three clusters of novel chromatin signatures that contain evolutionarily conserved sequences and potential cis-regulatory elements. Applying {ChromaSig} to a panel of 21 chromatin marks mapped genomewide by {ChIP}-Seq reveals 16 classes of genomic elements marked by distinct chromatin signatures. Interestingly, four classes containing enrichment for repressive histone modifications appear to be locally heterochromatic sites and are enriched in quickly evolving regions of the genome. The utility of this approach in uncovering novel, functionally significant genomic elements will aid future efforts of genome annotation via chromatin modifications.},

Blind to the number of spike-ins, their locations, and the range of concentrations, each group made predictions of the spike-in locations. We found that microarray platform choice is not the primary determinant of overall performance. In fact, variation in performance between labs, protocols, and algorithms within the same array platform was greater than the variation in performance between array platforms. However, each array platform had unique performance characteristics that varied with tiling resolution and the number of replicates, which have implications for  cost versus detection power. Long oligonucleotide arrays were slightly more sensitive at detecting very low enrichment. On all platforms, simple sequence repeats and genome redundancy tended to result in false positives. {LM}-{PCR} and {WGA}, the most popular sample amplification techniques, reproduced relative enrichment levels with high fidelity. Performance among signal detection algorithms was heavily dependent on array platform. The spike-in {DNA} samples and  the data presented here provide a stable benchmark against which future {ChIP} platforms, protocol improvements, and analysis methods can be evaluated.},

We identified approximately 24,000 promoters across these samples, including 16,976 annotated {mRNA} 5' ends and 5153 additional sites  validating cap-analysis of gene expression ({CAGE}) 5' end data. We showed that promoters with {CpG} islands are typically non-tissue specific, with the majority associated with Polr2a and the active chromatin modifications in nearly all the tissues examined. By contrast, the promoters without {CpG} islands are generally associated with Polr2a and the active chromatin marks in a tissue-dependent way.  We defined 4396 tissue-specific promoters by adapting a quantitative index of tissue-specificity based on Polr2a occupancy. While there is a general correspondence between Polr2a occupancy and active chromatin modifications at the tissue-specific promoters, a subset of them appear to be persistently marked by active chromatin modifications in the absence of detectable Polr2a binding, highlighting the complexity of the functional relationship between chromatin modification and gene expression. Our results provide a resource for exploring promoter Polr2a binding and epigenetic states across pluripotent and differentiated cell types in mammals.},

At least 98\% of {PspAs} are found in {PspA} families 1 or 2. {PspA} has been shown to interfere with complement deposition on pneumococci, thus reducing opsonization and clearance of bacteria by the host  immune system. Prior studies using pooled human sera have shown that {PspA} interferes with C3 deposition on a single strain of S. pneumoniae, {WU}2, and that  mouse antibody to {PspA} can enhance the deposition of C3 on {WU}2. The present studies have demonstrated that these previous findings are representative of most normal human sera and each of seven different strains of S. pneumoniae. It was observed that {PspAs} of {PspA} families 1 and 2 could inhibit C3 deposition in the presence of immunoglobulin present in all but 3 of 22 normal human sera. These studies have also demonstrated that rabbit and human antibody to {PspA} can enhance the deposition of C3 on pneumococci expressing either family 1 or 2 {PspAs} and either capsular types 2, 3, or 11. A vaccine candidate that can elicit immunity that neutralizes or compensates for S. pneumoniae's ability to thwart host immunity would be of value.},

To date, there are no known targets of human {FOXP}2 in the nervous system. The identification of {FOXP}2 targets in the developing human brain, therefore, provides a unique tool with which to explore the development of human language and speech. Here, we define {FOXP}2 targets in human basal ganglia ({BG}) and inferior frontal cortex ({IFC}) by use of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis ({ChIP}-chip) and validate the functional regulation of targets in vitro. {ChIP}-chip identified 285 {FOXP}2 targets in fetal human brain; statistically significant overlap of targets in {BG} and {IFC} indicates a core set of 34 transcriptional targets of {FOXP}2. We identified targets specific to {IFC} or  {BG} that were not observed in lung, suggesting important regional and tissue differences in {FOXP}2 activity. Many target genes are known to play critical roles in specific aspects of central nervous system patterning or development, such as  neurite outgrowth, as well as plasticity. Subsets of the {FOXP}2 transcriptional targets are either under positive selection in humans or differentially expressed between human and chimpanzee brain. This is the first {ChIP}-chip study to use human brain tissue, making the {FOXP}2-target genes identified in these studies important to understanding the pathways regulating speech and language in the developing human brain. These data provide the first insight into the functional  network of genes directly regulated by {FOXP}2 in human brain and by evolutionary comparisons, highlighting genes likely to be involved in the development of human higher-order cognitive processes.},

Mapping {DNaseI} hypersensitive ({HS}) sites is an accurate method for identifying the location of functional regulatory elements. We used a high throughput method called {DNase}-chip to identify 3,904 {DNaseI} {HS} sites from six cell types across 1\% of the human genome. A significant number (22\%) of {DNaseI} {HS} sites from each cell type are ubiquitously present among all cell types studied.  Surprisingly, nearly all of these ubiquitous {DNaseI} {HS} sites correspond to either promoters or insulator elements: 86\% of them are located near annotated transcription start sites and 10\% are bound by {CTCF}, a protein with known enhancer-blocking insulator activity. We also identified a large number of {DNaseI} {HS} sites that are cell type specific (only present in one cell type); these regions are enriched for enhancer elements and correlate with cell type-specific  gene expression as well as cell type-specific histone modifications. Finally, we  found that approximately 8\% of the genome overlaps a {DNaseI} {HS} site in at least one the six cell lines studied, indicating that a significant percentage of the genome is potentially functional.},

First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with {DNA} replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally,  integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome.

We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter {SLC}22A5 ({OCTN}2).

	abstract = {The proto-oncogene c-Myc plays a central role in cell growth and the development  of human tumors. c-Myc interacts with Max and Myc-Max complexes bind to E-box and related sequences to activate transcription. Max also interacts with Mnt but Mnt-Max complexes repress transcription when bound to these sequences. {MNT} maps to human chromosome 17p13.3, a region frequently deleted in various human tumors, including mammary gland tumors. Consistent with the possibility that Mnt functions as a Myc antagonist, Mnt-deficient fibroblasts exhibit many of the hallmark characteristics of cells that overexpress Myc, and conditional (Cre/Lox) inactivation of Mnt in mammary gland epithelium leads to adenocarcinomas. Here, we further characterize mammary gland tissue following conditional deletion of Mnt in the mammary gland. We show that loss of Mnt severely disrupts mammary gland involution and leads to hyperplastic ducts associated with reduced numbers  of apoptotic cells. These findings suggest that loss of Mnt in mammary tissue has similarities to Myc overexpression. We tested this directly by using promoter array analysis and {mRNA} expression analysis by oligonucleotide arrays. We found that Mnt and c-Myc bound to similar promoters in tumors from {MMTV}-c-Myc transgenic mice, and {mRNA} expression patterns were similar between mammary tumors from {MMTV}-Cre/Mnt({KO}/{CKO}) and {MMTV}-c-Myc transgenic mice. These results reveal an important role for Mnt in pregnancy-associated mammary gland development and suggest that mammary gland tumorigenesis in the absence of Mnt is analogous to that caused by Myc deregulation.},

A significant portion of the noncoding {DNA} is believed to serve as transcriptional regulatory elements that control gene expression in specific cell types at appropriate developmental stages. Identifying these regulatory sequences and determining the mechanisms by which they act present a great challenge in the postgenomic era. Previous investigations using genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches have uncovered a large number of proteins involved in regulating transcription. Knowledge of the genomic locations of {DNA} binding for these proteins in the nucleus should define the identity and nature of the transcriptional regulatory sequences and reveal the gene regulatory networks in cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}) is a common method for detecting interactions between  a protein and a {DNA} sequence in vivo. In recent years, this method has been combined with {DNA} microarrays and other high-throughput technologies to enable genome-wide identification of {DNA}-binding sites for various nuclear proteins. Here, we review recent advances in {ChIP}-based methods for genome-wide detection of protein-{DNA} interactions, and discuss their significance in enhancing our knowledge of the gene regulatory networks and epigenetic mechanisms in cells.},

This map defines 10,567 active promoters corresponding to 6,763 known genes and at least 1,196 un-annotated transcriptional units. Features of the map suggest extensive use of multiple promoters by the human genes and widespread clustering  of active promoters in the genome. In addition, examination of the genome-wide expression profile reveals four general classes of promoters that define the transcriptome of the cell.

Promoters mark the start of every transcript and are an important class of regulatory elements. A large, complex protein structure known as the pre-initiation complex ({PIC}) is assembled on all active promoters, and the presence of these proteins distinguishes promoters from other sequences in the genome. Using components of the {PIC} as tags, we isolated promoters directly from human cells as protein-{DNA} complexes and identified the resulting {DNA} sequences using genomic tiling microarrays. Our experiments in four human cell lines uncovered 252 {PIC}-binding sites in 44 semirandomly selected human genomic regions comprising 1\% (30 megabase pairs) of the human genome. Nearly 72\% of the identified fragments overlap or immediately flank 5' ends of known {cDNA} sequences, while the remainder is found in other genomic regions that  likely harbor putative promoters of unannotated transcripts. Indeed, molecular analysis of the {RNA} isolated from one cell line uncovered transcripts initiated from over half of the putative promoter fragments, and transient transfection assays revealed promoter activity for a significant proportion of fragments when  they were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. These results demonstrate the specificity of a genome-wide analysis method for mapping transcriptional regulatory elements and also indicate that a small, yet significant number of human genes remains to be discovered.},

However, the molecular mechanism controlling the expression of {EDN}1 in cancers is unknown. Constitutive  activation of beta-catenin pathway is responsible for the initiation of the vast  majority of colon cancers. Here we show that the {EDN}1 gene is directly regulated  by beta-catenin in colon cancer cells. A specific {DNA} element within the {EDN}1 promoter is required for activation, and is associated with beta-catenin's cognate {DNA} binding partner, {TCF}4, in vivo. Inhibition of beta-catenin signaling  results in lowered expression of {EDN}1, while enhancement of beta-catenin signaling leads to further activation of the gene. Significantly elevated {EDN}1 expression occurs in 80\% of primary human colon cancers, consistent with it being a direct target of beta-catenin. Furthermore, {EDN}1 is able to rescue colon cancer cells from growth arrest and apoptosis resulting from inhibition of beta-catenin  signaling, implicating a key role of {EDN}1 in promoting the oncogenic function of  beta-catenin. These results indicate {EDN}1 overexpression as a major cause in colon cancers and reveal further details of the genetic programs responsible for  tumorigenesis of colon cancers.},

Using naive mouse serum as a complement source, measurable deposition of C3 was observed within 4 min on {PspA}- pneumococci, and the amount of surface-bound C3 accumulated rapidly as the amount of serum was increased. In contrast, very little C3 was deposited on the {PspA}+ strain. In nonimmune mouse serum, the classical pathway was the dominant activation pathway triggered by {PspA}- pneumococci. Accordingly, {EGTA} blocked almost all of the complement activation. Moreover, a significant amount of C3 was still deposited on the {PspA}- strain when serum from factor B-deficient mice was used. This deposition was not observed on  the {PspA}+ pneumococci, indicating that {PspA} may inhibit complement deposition via the classical pathway. Furthermore, under the conditions we tested, {PspA} also inhibited C3 deposition when the classical pathway was initiated by antibodies to capsular polysaccharide.

The course of hyponatremia before the initiation of {CVVH} was 45 - 48 hours. {AN}69, {AV}600, {FH}66 and {HF}1200 hemofilters were applied and changed every 24 hours. The ultrafiltration rate was 2 000 ml/h, with a blood flow rate of 200 - 250 ml/min, and the substitute fluid  was infused by a pre-dilution route. Low molecular weight heparin was used for anticoagulation. {RESULTS}: The average treatment duration of {CVVH} was 59.7 (45.6 - 86) hours. All the patients survived and tolerated {CVVH} well. During {CVVH}, the serum sodium increased significantly from (101.2 +/- 4.2) mmol/L before {CVVH}, to  (115.0 +/- 2.7) mmol/L at the 6th hour of {CVVH}, (129.2 +/- 4.1) mmol/L at the 24th hour, and (140.3 +/- 1.6) mmol/L at the 48th hour of {CVVH}; with the correction rate of serum sodium controlled at (2.5 +/- 0.4) mmol.L(-1).h(-1) over the first 24 hours, (1.2 +/- 0.1) mmol.L(-1).h(-1) for the first 48th hour, and the correction rate of (0.82 +/- 0.10) mmol.L(-1).h(-1). The sodium concentrations in the replacement solution were (16.0 +/- 6.0) mmol/L higher than the serum sodium concentration at 0 hour, (11.6 +/- 4.3) mmol/L higher at 4th hour, (5.5 +/- 5.1) mmol/L higher at 24th hour, and (0.75 +/- 0.96) mmol/L higher at 48th hour of {CVVH}. After {CVVH}, the serum osmolarity increased significantly, from (216.7 +/- 7.4) {mOsm}/{kgH}(2)O pre-{CVVH}, to (245.0 +/- 5.5) {mOsm}/{kgH}(2)O at 6th hour, with a correction rate of (5.16 +/- 0.81) {mOsm}.{kgH}(2)O(-1).h(-1); (272.7 +/- 7.1) {mOsm}/{kgH}(2)O at 24th hour, with a correction rate of (2.33 +/- 0.28) {mOsm}.{kgH}(2)O(-1).h(-1); and (295.0 +/- 4.2) {mOsm}/{kgH}(2)O at 48th hour, with a correction rate of (1.63 +/- 0.20) {mOsm}.{kgH}(2)O(-1).h(-1). The Glasgow scores and {APACHEII} scores improved significantly as compared to pretreatment. {CONCLUSION}: {CVVH} is effective in the treatment of acute severe hyponatremia, and  could be considered as a treatment option because of its slow and continuous nature. A low-sodium replacement solution should be prepared to minimize its sodium concentration difference from the serum concentration. We recommend that the serum sodium concentration be corrected at an average rate of (2.50 +/- 0.14) mmol.L(-1).h(-1) at 6 h, (1.2 +/- 0.1) mmol.L(-1).h(-1) at 24 h and (0.82 +/- 0.10) mmol.L(-1).h(-1) at 48 h.},

	abstract = {Pneumococcal surface protein A ({PspA}) is able to elicit antibodies in mice and humans that can protect mice against fatal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has been observed that immunization with a single family 1 {PspA} can protect mice against infections with capsular type 3 or 6B strains expressing {PspA} family 1 or 2. However, several studies have shown that immunity to {PspA} is  less efficacious against several capsular type 4 strains than against strains of  capsular types 3, 6A, and 6B. To determine whether the greater difficulty in protecting against capsular type 4 strains resulted from differences in their {PspAs} or from differences in their genetic backgrounds, we performed protection experiments using four different challenge strains: a capsular type 3 strain expressing a family 1 {PspA} ({WU}2), a capsular type 4 strain expressing a family 2  {PspA} ({TIGR}4), and genetically engineered variants of {WU}2 and {TIGR}4 expressing each other's {PspAs}. Prior to infection, the mice were immunized with recombinant  family 1 or family 2 {PspA}. The results revealed that much of the difficulty in protecting against capsular type 4 strains was eliminated when mice were immunized with a homologous {PspA} of the same {PspA} family. However, regardless of  which {PspA} the strains expressed, those on the {TIGR}4 background were about twice  as hard to protect against as {WU}2 strains expressing the same {PspA} based on the efficacy rates seen in our experiments. These results point out the importance of including more than one {PspA} in any {PspA} vaccines developed for human use.},

To understand the molecular targets of c-Myc function, we have used an unbiased genome-wide location-analysis approach to examine the genomic binding sites of c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We find that c-Myc together with its heterodimeric partner, Max, occupy {\textgreater}15\% of gene promoters tested in these cancer cells. The {DNA} binding of c-Myc and Max correlates extensively with  gene expression throughout the genome, a hallmark attribute of general transcription factors. The c-Myc/Max heterodimer complexes also colocalize with transcription factor {IID} in these cells, further supporting a general role for overexpressed c-Myc in global gene regulation. In addition, transcription of a majority of c-Myc target genes exhibits changes correlated with levels of c-myc {mRNA} in a diverse set of tissues and cell lines, supporting the conclusion that c-Myc regulates them. Taken together, these results suggest a general role for overexpressed c-Myc in global transcriptional regulation in some cancer cells and point toward molecular mechanisms for c-Myc function in malignant transformation.},

The maximum flow rate was (1.82 +/- 0.03) L/min, (2.44 +/- 0.03) L/min, (3.02 +/- 0.04) L/min, (3.31 +/- 0.03) L/min respectively for polyvinyl cannulae with wall thickness of  0.5 mm ({PV} 0.5 cannula) and inner diameter of 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm; (1.83 +/- 0.03) L/min, (3.07 +/- 0.04) L/min respectively for the polyvinyl chloride cannula with wall thickness of 1.0 mm imbedded by spring wire ({PVCSW} 1.0) and inner diameter of 3 mm and 5 mm; (1.82 +/- 0.02) L/min, 1.84 +/- 0.02 L/min for strengthened polyvinyl cannula with wall thickness of 0.8 mm ({SPV} 0.8) and inner  diameter of 3 mm and polyvinyl cannula with wall thickness of 1.0 mm ({PV} 1.0 cannula) of inner diameter of 3 mm. There was no remarked statistical difference  in vitro maximum flow among the four cannulae of 3 mm inner diameter in vitro. {PVCSW} 1.0 was showed the best antifolding property, {PV} 1.0 cannula good and {SPV} 0.8 and {PV} 0.5 unsatisfactory in properties against fold.

	abstract = {Pneumococcal surface protein A ({PspA}), a virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae, is exceptionally diverse, being classified into two major families which are over 50\% divergent by sequence analysis. A family 1 {PspA} from strain {WU}2 was previously shown to impede the clearance of pneumococci from mouse blood  and to interfere with complement deposition on the bacterial surface. To determine whether a family 2 {PspA} can perform the same role as family 1 {PspA}, the family 1 {PspA} (from strain {WU}2) was replaced with a family 2 {PspA} (from strain {TIGR}4) by molecular genetic methods to make an isogenic pair of strains expressing different {PspA} proteins. Surface binding of lactoferrin and interference with C3 deposition by the two types of {PspA} proteins were determined by flow cytometry, and virulence was assessed in a mouse bacteremia model. Although the family 2 {PspA} appeared to bind less human lactoferrin than did the family 1 {PspA}, both {PspA} proteins could interfere with complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface and could provide full virulence in the mouse infection  model. A mutant form of the family 2 {PspA} with a deletion within the choline-binding region was also produced. Pneumococci with this mutant {PspA} failed to bind human lactoferrin even though the {PspA} was present on the pneumococcal surface. The mutant {PspA} only partially interfered with complement deposition and moderately attenuated virulence. These results suggest that family 1 and family 2 {PspA} proteins play similar roles in virulence and that surface accessibility of {PspA} is important for their function.},

	abstract = {The E2F transcription factor family is known to play a key role in the timely expression of genes required for cell cycle progression and proliferation, but only a few E2F target genes have been identified. We explored the possibility that E2F regulators play a broader role by identifying additional genes bound by  E2F in living human cells. A protocol was developed to identify genomic binding sites for {DNA}-binding factors in mammalian cells that combines immunoprecipitation of cross-linked protein-{DNA} complexes with {DNA} microarray analysis. Among approximately 1200 genes expressed during cell cycle entry, we found that the promoters of 127 were bound by the E2F4 transcription factor in primary fibroblasts. A subset of these targets was also bound by E2F1. Most previously identified target genes known to have roles in {DNA} replication and cell cycle control and represented on the microarray were confirmed by this analysis. We also identified a remarkable cadre of genes with no previous connection to E2F regulation, including genes that encode components of the {DNA} damage checkpoint and repair pathways, as well as factors involved in chromatin assembly/condensation, chromosome segregation, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Our data indicate that E2F directly links cell cycle progression with the coordinate regulation of genes essential for both the synthesis of {DNA} as well as its surveillance.},
