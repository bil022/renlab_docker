These files are supplementary files for the 3D QTL paper (Gorkin, Qiu, Hu et al. 2019). They include the following files: 

- Raw and processed Hi-C data from our study can be accessed via GEO under accession [GSE128678](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE128678) or via [4DN DCIC website]( http://dcic.4dnucleome.org). 

- A full list of processed files with detailed README files that are included GEO can be found at the link below:  
    * [Bam files for 25 samples and 50 replicates aligned using WASP pipeline](http://renlab.sdsc.edu/iQTL/data/bam_files/)
    * [Full results for QTL search](http://renlab.sdsc.edu/iQTL/data/qtls/)
    * [Contact matrices using raw read count w/o normalization](http://renlab.sdsc.edu/iQTL/data/raw_matrices/)
